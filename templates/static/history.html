        <p>Through a multitude recordings from the depths of the centuries, outlined the form and the identity which took the island of Skopelos. The study of the past, brings to light marks from the first centuries of ancient Greek history. The excavations made in the area of Stafilos during 1936, highlighted findings from the Mycenaean era ( 15th century B.C. ) and connected with the mythical inhabitant  Stafilos, son of Dionysos and Ariadne. According to legend, Stafillos’ brother was Peparithos from whom the island was named first. The Minoian grave found in the small peninsula of Stafilos was attributed to the mythical hero as the sword with a golden handle which is on display at the National Archaeological Museum.</p>

        <p>The 8th century B.C. was the period when Skopelos was colony of Chalcis, while the traces of ancient city Selinous, on the hill Palaio Kastro in Glossa, demonstrate that this area was inhabited at the same period. Over the next years the Olympic champion of 569 B. C. Agnon, from which came the name of the beach of Agnonta’s with the small harbor and the historian of the 3rd century B.C. Dioklis are referred to have inhabited the island. The findings of excavations to the gulf of Town of Skopelos, reveal the existence of a shrine from the 4th century B.C. dedicated to Aesculapius (god of medicine). Up until now, the operations have revealed amphorae, figured vessels, parts of statues, clay figurines and coins. From literary sources documented that the island joined in the Athenian alliance in classic times ( 5th and 4th century B.C. ), which has contributed significantly to progress and economic prosperity of Skopelos. The development was such that led to cutting silver and copper coins and the contribution of larger amounts to the common fund of the Alliance in comparison with the other islands of the region.</p>


        <p>After the end of the Peloponnesian war Skopelos was under the occupation of the Lacedaemonians, and later was an area of conflicts between the Athenians and the Macedonians. Well noted is the event of the occupation of the ancient city of Panormos by Alexander of Feres in 361 B.C. and until the 2nd century B.C. the whole area of Sporades had been taken under the possession of the Macedonians from the Phillip B’. Despite the administrative turmoil, the robust economy of the island is not disturbed and the port of Skopelos has been established as a significant part of the market of the Aegean Sea. The production and trade of a great quality wine, famed from earlier years, was spread from the Black Sea to the Alexandria of Egypt. In addition Skopelos was recognized as an important naval power and the privileged geographical position was an opportunity for residents to develop naval fleet, which verified by evidence ancient writers. </p>
