        <p>Although the history of the island begins in ancient times, the roots of the culture and traditions that integrate the identity of the island are identified from the 16th century onwards. The social structure imposed in the years of the Turkish occupation and has not ceased to exist in subsequent years, directly influenced the traditions, customs and people’s culture of Skopelos. The existence social classes disrupted the relationship of residents and maintained a poor as a whole, low standard of living, society. As a result, at the end of the 19th century, there were migratory tendencies toward America, Romania and Russia. With the travels of residents and in particular of sailors of the island, Skopelos came into contact with other European cultures. The consulates in Skopelos as early as the 18th century like the Venetian, English and France, shows that at a very early stage elements of western culture had invaded the island. So, the new goods that arrived on the island was welcome and the houses slowly acquired furniture, glassware, decorative dishes and various foreign objects. It is worth pointing out that this early assimilation of European features was an exception for the wider area of Sporades.</p>
         

        <p>The specific art forms that developed in Skopelos are reflected in the architecture of the houses, the furniture, the interior decoration, the crafts, the hagiographies and local traditional songs. Features of the rare tradition of the island are the countless legends (with references to foreign conquerors, Saints, exotic creatures and pirates’ treasures), the festivals in the chapels, the stories associated with the pastoral life, the carnivals and the intense religious life of residents.</p>

        <p>Each person may come into contact with the rich cultural heritage of the island, visiting the Folklore Museum or the Mansion of Vakratsa in Skopelos Town and the Folklore Museum in Glossa. There, in addition to the characteristics of a genuine Skopelos-type home, collections of images, embroidery, paintings, photographs, ceramics, tools and carved wooden furniture saved.
