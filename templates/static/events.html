        <p>The Skopelos International Film Festival for Youth (SIFFY) was first organized in 2009 with the cooperation of Professor Wangtae Lim from Dong-Ah Institute of Media and the Arts and Jill Somer, Associate Director of the Skopelos Foundation for the Arts. Since then, five festivals have been organized and were funded by private donors through Kickstarter campaigns. The festival lasts one week with three days of educational classes based on the yearly theme and then for the next four days students work in teams of six to eight with a professional filmmaker to create a short film. The students do everything from creating the initial idea, writing the scenario, camera, directing, acting and then they partially edit the film with the assistance of the professional filmmakers. The last evening the films are screened to the townspeople and at the Orpheus Cinema in downtown Skopelos to an audience of about six hundred people. The films are then circulated to festivals throughout the world. Films from various years have been screened in America, Asia and Europe. The works for 2016 are set for the period from 26/07 until 02/08.</p>

        <p>In 2013 the Cultural Association of Glossa organized the First Festival of Traditional Dances with the guidance of Diamantis Palaiologos, a great dance teacher but also beloved principal of the Glossa High School.

        <p>After the end of the Peloponnesian war Skopelos was under the occupation of the Lacedaemonians, and later was an area of conflicts between the Athenians and the Macedonians. Well noted is the event of the occupation of the ancient city of Panormos by Alexander of Feres in 361 B.C. and until the 2nd century B.C. the whole area of Sporades had been taken under the possession of the Macedonians from the Phillip B’. Despite the administrative turmoil, the robust economy of the island is not disturbed and the port of Skopelos has been established as a significant part of the market of the Aegean Sea. The production and trade of a great quality wine, famed from earlier years, was spread from the Black Sea to the Alexandria of Egypt. In addition Skopelos was recognized as an important naval power and the privileged geographical position was an opportunity for residents to develop naval fleet, which verified by evidence ancient writers. </p>
